### Something I want to say

I'm new to github and I'm learning how to use it.

My personal blog is just like a memorandum.

Obviously, almost no one browses my blog.
Therefore, I did not provide any version of the content except Chinese.

* **generator** : [Hugo][hugo-link]
* **theme**: [Blogfish][blowfish-link]

This blog repo was previously hosted on another platform, but its Pages service suddenly suspended.

At first, I liked to insert many pictures in the article.
But a repo needed to be kept under 1 GiB.
So I decided to just upload the **public** folder.
With time elapsing, I gradually grew tired of looking for pictures.
The old articles have also been updated and reorganized.
Nowadays, articles are quite simple.

### Future

* Add a comment system to blog.
* Learn more about licenses.
